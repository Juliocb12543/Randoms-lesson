# random
# Python comes with a built in random library. There are a lot of functions included in this random library, so we will only 
#show you two useful functions for now.
#print("random1")
# dice1 = randint(1,7)
# print(f"dice1 : {dice1}")
# dice2 = randint(1,7)
# print(f"dice2 : {dice2}")
# roll_doubles = dice1 == dice2
# if roll_doubles:
#   print("You rolled doubles")
# if dice1 and dice2 == 1:
#   print("You rolled snake eyes")
# else: print("You did not roll snake eyes")
# from random import shuffle
# # This shuffles the list "in-place" meaning it won't return
# # anything, instead it will effect the list passed
my_list = range(1,51)
print("My new list")
print(list(my_list))
my_list = list(my_list)

print(my_list)

# Random Practice #1
# Implement the randint() function from the random library that allows you to obtain an integer from 1 to 10, and store that value in a variable called random_number.
random_number = randint(1,10) 
print(random_number)
# Random Practice #2
# Implement the random() function from the random library to obtain a real number between 0 and 1, and store that value in a variable called random_number.
random_number = random()
print(random_number)
  
# Random Practice #3
# Use the random library's choice() method to get a random item from the list of names below, and store the chosen name in a variable called raffle.

names = ["Samantha", "Carrie", "Chris", "Charlotte", "Richard"]
raffle_winner = choice(names)
print(f"The raffle winner is {raffle_winner}")
